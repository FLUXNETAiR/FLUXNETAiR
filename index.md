<a href = "https://fluxnet.org/">FLUXNET</a> is a global network of micrometeorological tower sites. Our artist in residence program funded by the NSF and in partnership with the Patricia Valian Reser Center for the Creative Arts (<a href = "https://prax.oregonstate.edu/">PRAx</a>) aims to illuminate the scientific and societal significance of energy, water, and carbon flux research – to contemplate the biosphere’s ‘breath’, both to capture the general public’s imagination and to strengthen communication between academics and stakeholders toward more actionable science.
