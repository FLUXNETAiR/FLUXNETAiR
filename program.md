FLUXNET is blending art and science to empower society to feel and understand environmental change.

The intricate nature of our planet’s future and the uncertainties it carries offers countless opportunities for us to promote climate action and nurture healthy ecosystems. The bridge between the scientific achievements necessary for these goals and actual global change is constructed by our collective imagination. While both scientists and artists share a creative curiosity to observe and interpret how the world works, scientific outreach efforts often fail to lead society to fully feel and understand environmental change in a way that is empowering. This in turn limits the segment of the population that is inspired by science and driven to contribute to sustainable futures.

To break these barriers and reimagine transformative engagement with the public we are piloting a FLUXNET Artist Residency program in partnership with the Patricia Valian Reser Center for the Creative Arts (PRAx). This novel outreach initiative aims to illuminate the scientific and societal significance of energy, water, and carbon flux research – to contemplate the biosphere’s ‘breath’, both to capture the general public’s imagination and to strengthen communication between academics and stakeholders toward more actionable science.
For a period of one year, flux scientists and artists will engage in collaborative inquiry and curiosity-driven exploration about FLUXNET and their shared interests. This NSF-funded pilot program is being offered for the first time in 2024.
