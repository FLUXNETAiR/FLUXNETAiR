<b><i>flux</i><b>Art</b> made multiple appearances at AGU24, the American Geosciences Union’s annual meeting 9-13 Dec, 2024 in Washington DC, showcasing how art-science collaborations can transform our relationship with environmental change and help reimagine climate action.</b>

With presentations in sessions across multiple scientific disciplines, Maoya Bassiouni reached a wide range of researchers in the geosciences. She gave an overview of <b><i>flux</i><b>Art</b> and introduced the cohort of artists in residence and collaborators at the FLUXNET townhall. At the catchment science symposium, she gave a pop-up demonstration of pulsing flux data simulations generated by “Dyantra”, a digital art software developed by artist-in-residence David Glowacki. At the Google exhibit booth, AGU attendees experienced “18 // Flux” by artist-in-residence Julia Oldham. This video piece created using PhenoCam images was shown as part of the launch of FluxBench, an international project consortium bringing together flux scientists, remote sensing experts, and data scientists. 

<i>flux</i><b>Art</b> pieces at AGU revealed how creative inquiry and expression can transform environmental data into felt experiences of our living Earth, exemplifying the richness of information captured at flux towers sites and Earth observations and the challenges of bridging scales of understanding and applications.

Another highlight was the session "Acknowledging and Sharing Our Climate Grief". Maoya shared a meditation video and invited the audience to consider how the climate crisis is an opportunity to reveal new ways of understanding and being and how unexpected beauty and awe can emerge from the concept of ‘flux’. 

Through the metaphor of the ecosystem’s breath – the constant exchange of energy, water, and carbon – participants contemplated how ecosystems manifest pure radiant compassion. The invitation was to dissolve the boundary of self and the biosphere and experience breath, the constantl giving and receiving that sustains life on earth and brings us together.
