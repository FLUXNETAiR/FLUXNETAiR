<a href = "https://fluxnet.org/">FLUXNET</a> is a global network of micrometeorological tower sites. Our artist in residence program funded by the NSF and in partnership with the Patricia Valian Reser Center for the Creative Arts (PRAx) aims to illuminate the scientific and societal significance of energy, water, and carbon flux research – to contemplate the biosphere’s ‘breath’, both to capture the general public’s imagination and to strengthen communication between academics and stakeholders toward more actionable science.
