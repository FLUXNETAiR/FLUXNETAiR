<a href = "https://fluxnet.org/">FLUXNET</a> is a global network of micrometeorological tower sites that measure the exchanges of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere. 

Our artist in residence program, </i><b>fluxArt</i></b>, aims to contemplate the biosphere’s ‘breath’, both to illuminate flux science in the general public’s imagination and to strengthen communication between academics and society toward more actionable science. 

</i><b>fluxArt</i></b> is supported by the National Science Foundation’s Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations program (NSF AccelNet Award 2113978) and partnered with the Patricia Valian Reser Center for Creative Arts (<a href = "https://prax.oregonstate.edu/">PRAx</a>).

Our understanding of climate change depends on our understanding of ecosystem fluxes—how things like carbon, water, and energy move between the Earth (the biosphere) and the air (the atmosphere). These fluxes are regulated by ecosystem processes including photosynthesis and evapotranspiration and are also affected by human activities and natural disturbances including agriculture, burning of fossil fuels, drought and fire. 
Scientists around the world have set up nearly 1,000 towers instrumented to constantly collect data about carbon, water, and energy exchanges between the Earth and the air – they are observing how the biosphere breathes. The key measurement technique used to collect these flux data is called eddy covariance (https://www.youtube.com-/watch?v=CR4Anc8Mkas). It is the gold standard to measure total fluxes at the ecosystem scale without probing every plant and inch of soil on the landscape. There are eddy covariance towers in forests, grassland, croplands, wetlands, shrublands, savannas and the ocean in North America, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa. All of this data is shared through a global ‘network of networks’ called FLUXNET (https://fluxnet.org/) with a mission to facilitate collaboration and data sharing.
FLUXNET is much more than its datasets. It is a scientific community dedicated to understanding and communicating how ecosystems function and how Earth systems are changing. Having flux data in one place allows scientists to do big-picture thinking about climate change and develop Earth systems and climate models. Scientists also partner and engage with stakeholders to address applied environmental challenges with more local societal benefits. FLUXNET data and models are used to inform local and international ecosystem management efforts and climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.
